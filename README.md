# Odin Recipes

This is a simple HTML project built as part of the Foundations course in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML to practice working with:

- Basic HTML boilerplate
- Headings and paragraphs
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Anchor tags and links
- Image embedding

## Project Purpose

By completing this project, I aim to demonstrate a foundational understanding of HTML structure and semantics. Iâ€™ll gain confidence in writing clean, readable HTML code and organizing a simple multi-page website.

## Skills Learned

- Structuring HTML documents
- Linking between pages
- Embedding images
- Writing semantic content

This project is my first step toward becoming a full stack web developer!
